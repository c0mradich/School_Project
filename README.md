# 📚 Classroom Manager

**Classroom Manager** is a modern, full-stack web application designed to simplify classroom and learning space management.  
It allows teachers, school administrators, and managers to organize rooms, manage furniture, and store visual references in one centralized system.

---

## ✨ Overview

Traditional classroom management using spreadsheets and notes is inefficient and hard to scale.  
Classroom Manager solves this problem by providing a clean UI, cloud-based storage, and a production-ready backend architecture.

The project focuses on **clarity, scalability, and real-world usability**.
