# 📚 Classroom Manager

**Classroom Manager** is a modern, intuitive web application designed to simplify the management of classrooms and learning spaces.  
It helps teachers, school administrators, and project managers efficiently organize rooms, track furniture, and store visual references — all in one centralized system.
